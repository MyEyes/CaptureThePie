You will have to be a bit more creative with how you can take over the control flow this time.
The way you overwrote the GOT last time will also come in handy this time.
You will have to start a ROP chain somehow.
Ideally you can control a buffer on the stack and then get to redirect command execution afterwards.
Alternatively you can try to redirect the stack to some heap area you control.
You can write at an arbitrary location by using the memo trick from last challenge.
If you need 0s in your payload you can write a single 0 byte per arbitrary write, write your payload backwards.
