The code is compiled with <strong>PIE</strong>. That means that the base address of the binary will be somewhere else every time.
The flag is in the binary, so the address you are told also gives you information about where the binary has been loaded.

The first parameter to a function call is in <strong>r0</strong> so if you get the flags address in r0 you can print it out.
